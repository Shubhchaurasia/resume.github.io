        <b><li>Evaluation of Expression</li></b>
        <p class="p1">
          As part of B.Tech. Research Project (4th Semester, team of two), we
          used methods like (Infix, Prefix & Postfix Conversion), to achieve a
          correct Conversion in Expressions. In this project we convert the
          expressions. In this project we build full front-end work and little
          in back-end. I was responsible for the front-end that I developed
          using (C Language).

            Migration from Monolithic to Microservices Platform for Mypathshala
          </li></b
        >
        <p class="p1">
          Led the migration of Mypathshala's monolithic application from Digital
          Ocean to Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), decomposing it into
          microservices with Docker and Kubernetes. Implemented CI/CD pipelines
          with GitLab and set up a dedicated GitLab Runner environment on AWS
          for streamlined deployments. Centralized log management with Fluentd
          and Elasticsearch, executed complex database migration with minimal
          downtime, and migrated data to AWS S3, enhancing scalability,
          reliability, and reducing operational costs.

        <b><li>Karpenter Setup for Prasar Bharti's EKS Cluster</li></b>
        <p class="p1">
          Configured and deployed Karpenter on Prasar Bharti's Amazon EKS
          cluster to enhance scalability and security. The setup enabled
          dynamic, real-time scaling of resources, ensuring optimal performance
          during peak loads while reducing infrastructure costs. Implemented
          secure, automated node provisioning with Karpenter, integrating it
          with AWS security best practices to protect sensitive workloads. This
          solution provided Prasar Bharti with a robust, scalable, and secure
